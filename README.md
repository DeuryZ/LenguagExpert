## Context
Juan is the owner of LenguagExpert, a small language academy that offers classes in various languages. As the academy grows, Juan finds it increasingly challenging to manage all aspects of the business manually. He realizes the need for a comprehensive software solution that can streamline the management of materials, classes, students, teachers, employees, classrooms, schedules, and special activities.

### User Stories:
- As an administrator, I want to be able to manage materials effectively, including adding, updating, and deleting materials as needed, to ensure that our teaching resources are organized and up-to-date.

- As a scheduler, I want the software to allow me to create and manage class schedules for each classroom, ensuring efficient use of our facilities and avoiding conflicts in booking.

- As an administrator, I want to have a database of students where I can register new students, update their information when necessary, and remove them from the system if they no longer attend classes.

- As a teacher, I want to be able to access the schedule for my classes, view the materials assigned for each lesson, and update attendance records for my students, to facilitate efficient class management.

- As a student, I want to be able to access my class schedule, view any assigned materials or homework, and track my progress throughout the course, to stay organized and motivated in my studies.

- As an administrator, I want to have a database of teachers and employees, where I can manage their profiles, assign them to classes, and track their work hours and responsibilities.

- As an administrator, I want the software to provide options for managing special activities or events, such as workshops, cultural events, or language exchange programs, to enrich the learning experience for our students.

- As a user, I want the software to have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, with clear menus and options, to minimize the learning curve and maximize efficiency in using the system.

- As an administrator, I want the software to have robust security features to protect sensitive data, such as student information and financial records, from unauthorized access or data breaches.

- As an administrator, I want the software to generate reports and analytics on various aspects of the academy's operations, such as student enrollment, class attendance, and teacher performance, to inform decision-making and improve overall efficiency.
